# Friendly-Friends

"Friendly Friends!" is the very first of our classes' applications to use the browser with Express for a server and a router outside of the terminal. It uses Bootstrap CSS.

## How to Use

In "Friendly Friends!" the user takes a survey in which he or she responds to a statement or question on a scale of one to five. Based on the user's answers he or she is paired with a friend who's answer pattern most closely matches that of the user. A model pops up with the name and (usually) the picture of the friend.
